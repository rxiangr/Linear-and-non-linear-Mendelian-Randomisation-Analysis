# Code used for data processing, linear regression and Mendelian Randomisation for analysis of sleep disruptions and blood pressure

This is a repository for codes used in Mendelian-Randomisation (MR) analyses.

Linear MR: GSMR (https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gsmr/), weighted median and egger (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MendelianRandomization/vignettes/Vignette_MR.pdf).

Non-linear MR: PolyMR (https://github.com/JonSulc/PolyMR) and SUMnlmr (https://github.com/amymariemason/SUMnlmr). 

These codes are for the paper "Poor sleep and shift work associate with increased blood pressure and inflammation in UK Biobank participants" in Press in Nature Communications.
